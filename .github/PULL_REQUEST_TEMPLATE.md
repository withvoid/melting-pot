<!-- 
  Pull requests are always greeted with happiness, but before opening a PR it 
  is better to open an issue and discuss it with the team. If itâ€™s a current issue 
  that you want to work on, just leave a comment asking if you can take that issue. 
  Sometimes an issue is already in progress of being fixed. This way, we can ensure 
  that your precious time doesnâ€™t get wasted. 
-->

As creating an issue or a pull request, please begin it with the following prefixes
- [Breaking] (For a change that will break the API)
- [Enhancement] (For when you add something that doesnâ€™t break the API or adds more functionality to the current API)
- [Fix] (For when you fix something that previously didnâ€™t function or appear correctly)
