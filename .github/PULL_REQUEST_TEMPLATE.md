<!-- Pull requests are always greeted with happiness, but before opening a PR it is better to open an issue and discuss it with the team. If it’s a current issue that you want to work on, just leave a comment asking if you can take that issue. Sometimes an issue is already in progress of being fixed. This way, we can ensure that your precious time doesn’t get wasted. -->

As creating an issue or a pull request, please begin it with the following prefixes
- [Breaking] (For a change that will break the API)
- [Enhancement] (For when you add something that doesn’t break the API & adds more functionality to the current API)
- [Fix] (For when you fix something that previously didn’t function or appear correctly)
