# Getting Started

Ahoy Matey! Welcome to <strong>melting-pot</strong>, a set of react helper utils
that you can use in your daily projects.

## Introduction

<strong>Melting Pot</strong> is a utility library for react. Which included a 
wide range from <strong>render-props</strong> to <strong>hooks</strong> to 
<strong>redux</strong> helper methods. It is mostly for my own internally use. 
The stuff that I end up using in my day to day normal work flow.

I wanted to make this public, if anyone else finds this helpful, then that makes
me happy. Cheers.

## Getting Started

Installing it with `npm`

```
npm install @withvoid/melting-pot
```

Or if you are using `yarn` (I love this 😄)

```
yarn add @withvoid/melting-pot
```
